"""Deprecated standalone smoke script placeholder.

This file previously contained a manual distributed-validator smoke runner.
The implementation was removed as dead, unreferenced repository code.
Use pytest-based coverage in `tests/` instead.
See TODO.md for follow-up if a maintained CLI smoke utility is needed.
